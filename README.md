# üêù Homebridge Bee Hive üêù

This plugin came about because the one I was using seemed very unreliable. The plugin only supports *Light Switches* I do intend to enhance the feature set in the future, so hang tight. Alternatively, make a PR!

# Homebridge

This is a plugin for Homebridge. Get started by visiting their GitHub page [https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

# Installation

`npm install -g homebridge-bee-hive`

You'll then need to modify your `config.json` file to contain the following...
